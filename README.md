# mapping_earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge and module was to create a map that shows earthquake data with GeoJSON. Completing this challegne was good test of using GeoJSON. Also this module covered branching on github which i found extremely help. Even though there were a couple times where it was as straight forward as expected. 

## Result 
Created a map shows the tectonic plates, recent earthquakes and, major earthquakes. As shown below. All Layers can be toggled.
